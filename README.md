# Mododificil

This project has come a long way, since it is the beginning of my learning and where I have applied most of my knowledge.

This project is a landing page that includes a blog with posts that I am constantly updating.

In this landing page I have applied knowledge of programming languages such as: HTML, CSS, BootStrap, Tailwind, Firebase, Angular, Cloudflare, among others.

## Develoment

This was my first page and is the reason because I was want to have idea of the structure of the app.

As I'm not a designer, I helped myself with some online tools like [Mockflow](https://mockflow.com/) and finally created my mockup en Figma.

After doing that, the structure of my app go to do ordered in my mind.

First I created my Angular-app and installed CSS (this was in my first versions) because I found that I can use framework like BootStrap, Tailwind between other with You can design and add styles betters.

Separated all my components and folders in a way that I can understand if I have what do changes. Also, it is useful to me, so I use this order in others projects like a guide.


Have a folder for each use is a great tool of learning because I learned the functionality of services, data, page, and UI.

## üí™üèΩ What impacted me positively

- The evolution of web application is the same as my learning.

- Every learning of a new style framework, a new concept or a new version of Angular is reflected here. I started with Angular V8.
- The refactoring and the order it started with is currently very different. Leaving learnings about clean code, application architecture, design and more.

  ## My challenge
- Learn new syntax in style frameworks.

- The decision of where to host the data changed more than 3 times between Firebase, my own backend application that was more of a manager, and finally my own project that used Markdown.

- For server side rendering, I first had my domain and used "good daddy" and then switched to Cloudflare because it was free.

- Making the routes work was a task that involved more than 10 prototypes.

- I solved the functionality of displaying a certain amount of post on the home page with this service.
